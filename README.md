TI MSP430 User Library
=====
A namespace-oriented wrapper library for using the TI MSP430.

Building
-----
The included makefile in `src` does a little work in finding the correct compiler to use.
Change MSP430PATH to the directory where MSP430 files are (bin, lib, include, etc.).
Change MSP430MCU to the MCU to compile for.
